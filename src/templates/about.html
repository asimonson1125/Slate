    <h2>About Slate</h2>
    <h4>Slate will never reveal users' calendars or event details to users.</h4>
    <p>Slate is an event coordination tool that combines the calendars of participants to automatically generate a table
        representing when the most participants can attend.</p>
    <p>Although not initially inspired by the <a href="https://www.when2meet.com/?About">Where2Meet</a> site, Slate
        replicates many aspects of Where2Meet and expands upon it via automated long-term data collection and more
        flexible use cases.</p>
    <p><a href="https://slate.cs.house">The initial version of Slate</a> is the 2021-22 major project by Andrew
        Simonson.</p>
    <p>In <a href='https://www.slate.csh.rit.edu'>Slate 2.0</a> the project (now 2022-23 major project, also Andrew 
        Simonson) gained a much improved UX, large performance improvements, <a href='https://www.csh.rit.edu'>
        Computer Science House</a> service integration, and basic analytics. This iteration is the first I consider 
        publishable (delivers on all objectives and is user-friendly)</p>
    
    <h4>The source code for Slate and its further development can be found on 
        <a href="https://github.com/asimonson1125/Slate">Github</a>.</h4>

    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <h4>The example usage (in nav bar) shows a sample output.  No work required :)</h4>
    <p>Every participant has three attributes, a URL, Name, and Score.</p>
    <p>Slate is spreadsheet friendly! If you have a list of URLS, names, or scores, paste them in divided by newlines
        and
        the URLs will automatically overflow into new participant inputs.</p>
    <h4>URL</h4>
    <p>URLS are references to ics (iCalendar files) online. Most digital calendars use (or can export) ics calendars.
    </p>
    <p><span class='bold'>Google Calendar:</span> Open calendar settings. Under 'Integrate Calendar', copy 'Public address in iCal format'.
        Depending on preferences, your calendar might need to be made public.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">iCloud Calendars (iOS):</span> in 'Edit Calendar', turn on 'Public Calendar' and share link.</p>

    <h4>Name</h4>
    <p>Optional input, names the participant. Defaults to 'Unnamed ##'</p>

    <h4>Score</h4>
    <p>Scores determine the value of a participant's attendance. The higher the score, the worse it is when they cannot
        attend.</p>
    <p>Scores of -1 indicate a mandatory attendance (aka the key speaker cannot make it or the room is not available)
        and
        such timeslots will be greyed out.</p>
