Schedule events with others' plans in mind

### What's the point of events without turnout?
Scheduling events can be tricky - with so many people, having everyone sift through their calendars to find times when most people can attend is a little tedious at best and a logistical nightmare at its worst.

Slate streamlines this process by collecting calendar data from participants and automatically determining the best times to meet.

## Goals
* Users can add their Google and Apple calendars to their profile
* Users can select participants and view their shared availabilities as determined by their calendars compiled into a single documemt
* Coordinators can filter availability options by time of the day and days of the week
* Filter by required attendance - exclude all times that essential participants (like event locations or guest speakers) can't make.

## Stretch targets
* If an event has a location, subtract availability times following events also with location data by determining travel time + gradient for margin of error
